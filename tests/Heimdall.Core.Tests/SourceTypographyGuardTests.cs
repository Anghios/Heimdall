/// <remarks>
/// <para>This is the same rule <see cref="DocumentationTypographyGuardTests"/> applies to public
/// documentation, applied to the other two places a character reaches a user: the C# and XAML
/// sources under <c>src/</c>, and the localized strings in every catalogue that ships under
/// <c>locales/</c>. A plain ASCII character says the same thing and survives a Windows
/// terminal, a diff, a console code page and a CI log; a typographic substitute does not.</para>
/// <para>Arrows, box-drawing characters, ballot boxes, emoji and every French or Spanish accent are NOT
/// refused. An accent is an accent, not typography. See <see cref="AccentsAndArrowsAreNotRefused"/>,
/// which exists because an allow-list and a remedy table both read as a list of code points, and
/// confusing the two yields a banned set that includes the accents themselves.</para>
/// <para>The refusal is on the character as it appears to a reader, so locale values are compared
/// after JSON unescaping: the catalogues mix literal UTF-8 with <c>\uXXXX</c> escapes, and a raw
/// byte scan of <c>en.json</c> sees 11 of its 121 em dashes. C# sources are scanned raw on purpose:
/// a <c>'×'</c> escape in source is ASCII in the file, survives every pipe, and is the
/// supported way to keep a non-ASCII character in a parser's input alphabet.</para>
/// <para>The scan is recursive, and <see cref="TheScanReachesSubdirectories"/> asserts that it
/// actually reaches one. A sweep that silently stops at the top directory reports success having
/// read almost nothing, which is how a whole typography campaign once passed green.</para>
